# How does it compare to ...

## GitHub Actions

- GitHub Actions is great at running scripts, but can be fiddly to write the
  yaml. With CodeHerald it is easy to setup complex triggering rules and it can
  dispatch workflows when the rules match.
- GitHub Actions live in code and have to be set up individually for each
  repository. Meanwhile, CodeHerald can have a single rule listen to multiple
  repositories at once.

## Big Automation (like tray.io, Zapier, etc.)

- Big Automation can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars depending on the team
  size. CodeHerald is free. We do intend to offer a paid plan, but as our
  maintenance costs are much lower - the product will also cost comparatively
  less.
- Big Automation is a powerful one size-fits all solution. CodeHerald narrows
  down to one specific niche developers and teams using GitHub.
